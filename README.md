# Many a character

A mod that increases the 256 characters limit on messages to 16384, for those times you want to paste a massive summon/give command, or just for play with friends.

The mod works in singleplayer, or in multiplayer as long as the server has the mod too.

Not recommended to use on servers without this mod, as accidentally sending a message over 256 characters will get you kicked.
